## The Jacobson-Witt Lie Algebras
- The definition of the Jacobson-Witt Lie Algebras can be found in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0508373.pdf, page 47.
- The motivation of the scripts is to make Lie brackets calculations easier and to be able to search single brackets presentation of any element in the algebra.
- `witt_algebra.py` is for the Witt Algebra W(1;1). `jacobson_witt_algebra.py` is for the general Jacobson-Witt Algebra W(m;1), m > 1.
- `functions.py` contains some useful searching functions.
- Libraries to install: SymPy, NumPy.
