## The Jacobson-Witt Lie Algebras and their Automorphisms
- The definition of the Jacobson-Witt Lie Algebras can be found in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0508373.pdf, page 47.
- The motivation of the scripts is to make Lie brackets calculations easier; to be able to search single brackets presentation of any element in the algebra; and to make automorphism computations on the algebra.
- `witt_algebra.py` is for the Witt Algebra W(1;1). `jacobson_witt_algebra.py` is for the general Jacobson-Witt Algebra W(m;1), m > 1.
- `truncated_polynomial_ring.py` is for the corresponding truncated polynomial ring.
- `automorphisms.py` is for automorphisms computations.
- `functions.py` contains some useful searching functions.
- Libraries to install: SymPy, NumPy.
